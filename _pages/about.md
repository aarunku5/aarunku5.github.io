I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in the [Khoury Vis Lab](https://vis.khoury.northeastern.edu) at Northeastern University, working with [Lace Padilla](http://www.lacepadilla.com). I graduated from Arizona State University, supervised by [Chris Bryan](https://chrisbryan.github.io/), where I was a recipeient of the <i>__Dean's Dissertation Award__</i>. I have also previously interned at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL).

My research lies at the intersection of <i>__visual cognition__</i>, <i>__artificial intelligence__</i>, and <i>__data visualization__</i>.  I focus on creating <ins>inclusive</ins> data visualizations that <ins>democratize</ins> both creation and consumption for underrepresented populations. Specifically, I examine the influence of <i>__multicultural and linguistic factors__</i>, as well as <i>__cognitive biases__</i>, on how people engage with and make decisions using visualizations. Additionally, I have extensively developed <i>__visual analysis platforms__</i> to support <i>__non-expert__</i> users in developing <i>__large language models__</i> and refining insights gained from <i>__artificial intelligence__</i> agents.

Looking ahead, I am excited to expand my research at the intersection of visualization, decision science, and artificial intelligence, to develop <i>__data communication paradigms__</i> such as <i>patient decision aids</i>, <i>personalized learning pathways</i>, and <i>risk management frameworks</i>, that empower <ins>low data literacy</ins> populations to take informed decisions.

I am always open to discussing new ideas and potential collaborations. Please feel free to email me to chat!

<ins>__I am currently on the job market, and looking for tenure track positions!__</ins>
