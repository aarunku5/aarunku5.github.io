I am a 4th year PhD student in the School of Computing and Augmented Intelligence, Arizona State University. I'm a member of the Sonoran Visualization Laboratory (SVL @ ASU), supervised by [Chris Bryan](https://chrisbryan.github.io/).

My research interests lie at the intersection of <i>__visual cognition__</i>, <i>__natural language__</i>, and <i>__data visualization__</i>. Specifically, I investigate how <i>__visualization aesthetics and affordances__</i> influence <i>__decision-making__</i>, and build visual analytics pipelines. I also have a background in exploring bias in natural language models, learning from instructions/prompting, and investigating the influence of visualization techniques in supply chain and project management. 

Other related areas I'm excited about include developing visualization recommendation systems based on natural language queries, investigating annotation effects in visualizations, and visualizing uncertainty.

I am currently interning at the __National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)__ for Summer 2023. I'm always open to discuss new ideas and collaborate, do email to chat!
